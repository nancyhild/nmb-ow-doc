Introduction

The Nimbella platform's command-line interface (CLI), called `nim`, is largely based on the [Apache OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org) platform's CLI. If you're an OpenWhisk developer, you'll recognize the nim-flavored commands here. If you're not familiar with the concept of projects in the Nimbella Cloud, start with the [Nimbella Command Line Tool guide](https://nimbella.io/downloads/nim/nim.html) and come here for the full set of commands.
